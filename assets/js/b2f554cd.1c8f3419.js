It supports most of the popular shells (Bash, Powershell, zsh, Fish, ...) and works cross platform on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Think of it like oh-my-zsh, but for all shells and platforms. Define your theme once and use it on any shell and any platform.\\n\\n## Why do I use it?\\n\\nBecause I am using Powershell on Windows and Bash on Linux I hat two completely different setups before knowing about Oh My Posh. With Powershell I used [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) and with Bash I used [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt). This setup worked, but it was tidious to maintain and update.\\n\\nAfter I found Oh My Posh my setup is much simplier. I have defined [my own custom theme](https://github.com/sonallux/oh-my-posh-theme) once and can reuse it everywhere.\\n\\n![sonallux Oh My Posh theme](./oh-my-posh-theme.png)"},{"id":"hello-world","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-world","editUrl":"https://github.com/sonallux/sonallux.github.io/tree/main/blog/2022-12-03-hello-world.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-03-hello-world.md","title":"Hello World","description":"I welcome everyone on my personal blog.
