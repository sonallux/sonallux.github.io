# Signals

Since Angular 17 Signals are production ready. Only the `effect` function is still under developer preview.

Signals can be used everywhere in Angular. 

```ts
class Service {
  private state = signal({
    from: '',
    to: '',
    flights: []
  });

  public readonly from = computed(() => this.state().from);
  public readonly to = computed(() => this.state().to);
}
```

Signals have an effect on change detection in Angular. Refer to the dedicated section about [change detection](change-detection) to learn more about this.

## Signal Inputs

Since Angular 17.1 inputs can be signals, so components can react easily to input changes.
