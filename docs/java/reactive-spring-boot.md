# Reactive Spring Boot

For reactive programming Spring Boot utilises [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io). 

There is a blog post series on the [Spring blog](https://spring.io/blog) about Context Propagation with Project Reactor:
1. [The Basics](https://spring.io/blog/2023/03/28/context-propagation-with-project-reactor-1-the-basics)
2. [The bumpy road of Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://spring.io/blog/2023/03/29/context-propagation-with-project-reactor-2-the-bumpy-road-of-spring-cloud)
3. [Unified Bridging between Reactive and Imperative](https://spring.io/blog/2023/03/30/context-propagation-with-project-reactor-3-unified-bridging-between-reactive)
