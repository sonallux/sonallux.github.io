# Observability

With Observability we try to understand a system from the outside without knowing its inner workings. So the information is just collected from the outputs of the system. This data is provided by some kind of instrumentation, which can expose three kind of signals:

- [Metrics](./metrics)
- [Traces](./traces)
- [Logs](./logs)

# Open Telemetry

[Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is a vendor- and tool-agnostic framework for creating, collecting, transforming and exporting telemetry/observability data.
